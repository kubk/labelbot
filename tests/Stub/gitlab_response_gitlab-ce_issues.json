I have to somehow save it on my local file system first, then go through the cycle above.\n\nThe proposal is to automate this process, like it is done in the issue/MR description field for example. Another example of proper implementation of this feature can be found on https://hackmd.io\n\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nI paste image or image file directly from clipboard, or drag-and-drop it into contents of Markdown file → Image gets saved automatically → Proper image markdown \"tag\" gets added to the contents of the file.","state":"opened","created_at":"2018-06-16T16:42:34.511Z","updated_at":"2018-06-16T16:43:12.664Z","closed_at":null,"closed_by":null,"labels":[],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":246853,"name":"inem","username":"inem","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://assets.gitlab-static.net/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/246853/inem_smaller.jpg","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/inem"},"assignee":null,"user_notes_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/48019","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"weight":null},{"id":12076561,"iid":48018,"project_id":13083,"title":"Preview Pipeline Graph In CI Lint/ Web IDE","description":"### Problem to solve\n* Easier CI pipeline/ job editing\n\n### Further details\n* Whilst editing gitlab-ci.yml in the web IDE/ the CI Lint, a preview of the resultant jobs and pipeline would make it that little bit faster to visualise the pipeline as a whole rather than just seeing individual information on the jobs and having to piece it together.\n\n### Proposal\n* Add a preview of the pipeline whilst editing/ after reviewing the gitlab-ci.yml file or using the CI lint","state":"opened","created_at":"2018-06-16T14:32:46.885Z","updated_at":"2018-06-16T14:32:46.885Z","closed_at":null,"closed_by":null,"labels":[],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":1790799,"name":"Jefferson Bledsoe","username":"JeffersonBledsoe","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://assets.gitlab-static.net/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1790799/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/JeffersonBledsoe"},"assignee":null,"user_notes_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/48018","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"weight":null},{"id":12076112,"iid":48017,"project_id":13083,"title":"Timestamps in UI sometimes shows elapsed hours but renders days","description":"It seems the date and time which are shown by Gitlab.com are sometimes incrrect.
